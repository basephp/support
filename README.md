# Essential PHP Functionality

This package is to help **simplify your PHP development**. Since PHP is never consistent with it's method naming, this package gives you an alternative that simplifies the use of core php functions. Some concepts in this package have been taken from the support classes of the Laravel framework since those classes are primarily focused dependant. This package has **no dependencies** and can be used in any of your PHP projects.
