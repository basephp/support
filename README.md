# Essential PHP Functionality

The use of this package is to help simplify PHP development by organizing specific tasks. Since PHP is never consistent with it's method naming, this package gives you an alternative that simplifies the use of core php functions. Some concepts in this package have been taken from the support classes of the Laravel framework since those classes are primarily focused dependant. This package has no dependencies and can be used in any of your PHP projects.
